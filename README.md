# Weather Map

React application created with TypeScript and Scss. The website uses two APIs: OpenWeatherMap and Google-maps. User can click on any position on the map and the latitude and logitude are passed to the OpenWeatherMap API call to get the weather data for chosen position.

All components are tested with Jest and Enzyme and the data is displayed by Chart.js and modified by styled-components.
